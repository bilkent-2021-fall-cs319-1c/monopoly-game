# Introduction

We will implement the “_Monopoly Classic_” game. Game rules will be taken from the [official Monopoly website](https://monopoly.hasbro.com/en-us/product/monopoly-classic-game:7EABAF97-5056-9047-F577-8F4663C79E75). We intend to develop a server-client architecture where multiple clients will connect to a single server and the server will handle clients’ game commands. In addition to online gameplay, we are planning to implement offline gameplay over local networks. Our game will use the official copyrighted assets.
